	<div class="panel" class="whole">
		<p>

				<li>From Source - One Drive Shared with you permission works in two method: </li>
				<ul type="square">
					<li>Users shared to you in link manner – we cannot retain those shares from the migration tool, you need to request the Owner to re share the  folder or files</li>
					<li>Users Shared to you either folder/files in advance access share  manner  – permission will restored as same once the permission delta sync completed by the tool </li>
					<li>If partial users migrated to new tenant can they use new one drive – this vary between India & North America </li>
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>For North America we advise the users to use  old one drive due to delta sync will initiated during the final phase which over right the new file in the destination if they were using the destination  one drive </li>
						<li>For India users cannot login into their one drive are any of the other service due to the upn changes immediately in the source when they destination with UPN </li>
						<li>For India users – people who migrated their shared link will break automatically to the invited participants due to UPN change </li>
						<li>Once all  the users migrated permission delta sync will initiated to regain the permission for those folder and users </li>
